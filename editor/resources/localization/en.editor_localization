# Key naming convention:
# 1. Use dot-separated hierarchy (from broad to specific)
# 2. Use at least 2 dot-separated elements
# 3. Use lower-cased kebab-case
# 4. Avoid suffixes baked into the last path element (e.g., -label, -button)
# 5. For dialog elements, use consistent names: title, header, detail, content
# 6. Use label as a penultimate element of form input keys: <ctx>.label.<input>
# 7. Use button as a penultimate element of button keys: <ctx>.button.<name>
# 8. Use ellipsis character (…) instead of triple dots (...)
