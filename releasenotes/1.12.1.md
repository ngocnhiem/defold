__NEW__: ([#11447](https://github.com/defold/defold/pull/11540)) __'Add support for http proxy connections'__ by britzl
HTTP requests can now specify a proxy server to use when connecting to the destination server. When a proxy is used the connection to the destination server is established using an a HTTP tunnel through the proxy. The HTTP tunnel is established using the [CONNECT HTTP method](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Reference/Methods/CONNECT).

```lua

		pprint(response)
	end, headers, post_data, options)
```

__NEW__: ([#9505](https://github.com/defold/defold/pull/11664)) __'Replaced the deprecated `ALooper_pollAll` call with `ALooper_pollOnce`'__ by AGulev
`ALooper_pollAll` has been deprecated due to [a potential race condition](https://github.com/android/ndk-samples/issues/999). It has been replaced with `ALooper_pollOnce` in the engine code.

__NEW__: ([#11739](https://github.com/defold/defold/pull/11740)) __'Report old and new shader combinations'__ by Jhonnyg
When mixing old and new shader pipelines, we currently show a warning but don't tell the users which shaders is causing it. Instead, we now show which shader resources that are causing this to happen.

__NEW__: ([#11429](https://github.com/defold/defold/pull/11436)) __'Added editor option to select when to build with the profiler'__ by JCash
This allows for the option to use the profiler in a release build.

__NEW__: ([#11577](https://github.com/defold/defold/pull/11584)) __'Add support for mounting live update archives from Android assets'__ by britzl
It is now possible to mount a live update archive located inside the assets folder of an Android bundle by using a specific prefix to the archive path:

```lua
liveupdate.add_mount("my_mount", "zip:/android_asset/myassets.zip", priority, callback)
```

The archive can be added to the Android bundle using the bundle resources option or as an install-time Play Asset Delivery pack.

__NEW__: ([#11558](https://github.com/defold/defold/pull/11626)) __'Fix regex for linux shared libraries'__ by ekharkunov


__NEW__: ([#11164](https://github.com/defold/defold/pull/11629)) __'Removed unnecessary lock of main thread when loading many large textures'__ by britzl
This change makes sure that the resource system doesn't lock the main thread when loading many large textures (or other large resources).

__FIX__: ([#11526](https://github.com/defold/defold/pull/11526)) __'Update LuaJIT'__ by AGulev
This update resolves performance issues on arm64 platforms with JIT enabled, such as `arm64-mac`, `arm64-android`, and `arm64-linux`.

__FIX__: ([#11541](https://github.com/defold/defold/pull/11541)) __'Performance optimisations for atlas creation'__ by AGulev
These improvements reduced the total atlas build time in Bob.jar from ~2850ms down to ~1100ms for a tested atlas (8192x4096, 4818 images on MBP M1 Max), including a drop in layout calculation time from ~1300ms down to ~490ms. With the reduced algorithmic complexity, adding more images will affect performance far less than before.

__FIX__: ([#11547](https://github.com/defold/defold/pull/11547)) __'Bob performance optimizations for sequential builds'__ by AGulev
Load the native libraries used for shader, model and texture building in advance during Bob’s initialisation stage, and do it in parallel. This can save up to 2 seconds during a rebuild when all three libraries are needed. While that might not be a big deal for a full build, for sequential builds (builds without `clean`) it can be a noticeable improvement (for example, 4s -> 2s).

__FIX__: ([#11517](https://github.com/defold/defold/pull/11555)) __'Fixed missing delete key binding on HTML5'__ by britzl
The delete key was not correctly identified in HTML5 builds.

__FIX__: ([#11609](https://github.com/defold/defold/pull/11609)) __'Improved atlas texture creation speed in the editor'__ by AGulev


__FIX__: ([#11613](https://github.com/defold/defold/pull/11614)) __'Unblock main thread while loading a collection and a texture at the same time'__ by britzl
This fixes an issue where the main thread locked for an extender period of time when loading and initialising a collection while at the same time doing a texture upload on Vulkan.

__FIX__: ([#11624](https://github.com/defold/defold/pull/11624)) __'Various leak fixes: SSL socket, physics, script table, game system, engine'__ by JCash


__FIX__: ([#11678](https://github.com/defold/defold/pull/11678)) __'Make sure the mesh component buffer's version is taken into account when updating the vertex buffer'__ by JCash
This fixes an issue when setting a buffer via the "vertices" property, and the vertex buffer wasn't updated.

__FIX__: ([#11679](https://github.com/defold/defold/pull/11679)) __'Fixes in the Vulkan graphics backend'__ by JCash
The issue presented itself when running with diagnostics, but could lead to odd behaviors at runtime.
The fixes:
* an image size was occasionally miscalculated, which could result in a read out-of-bounds
* the graphics async state was written to twice, in a non thread safe manner

__FIX__: ([#10571](https://github.com/defold/defold/pull/11706)) __'Dont use valueptr for models in GetProperty for material constants'__ by Jhonnyg
Fixed an issue where using `go.animate` to animate material constants would cause model hashes to not be updated. This would cause model instancing to behave incorrectly.

__FIX__: ([#11627](https://github.com/defold/defold/pull/11709)) __'Added Safe Area related functionality'__ by AGulev
Safe Area support for Android and iOS phones is now available in the engine out of the box.
You can control how the GUI respects the safe area using `gui.safe_area_mode = none|long|short|both` in `game.project`, with the option to override this per GUI scene at runtime via `gui.gui.set_safe_area_mode(gui.SAFE_AREA_*)`.

This allows UI elements to stay within safe zones on devices with notches, while still using the full screen when no cutout is present (On platforms without cutouts, the inset values are returned as 0).
The new `window.get_safe_area()` API provides the current safe area rectangle along with inset values, making it possible to use this data in custom layout and positioning logic.

__FIX__: ([#11689](https://github.com/defold/defold/pull/11718)) __'`bob.jar` now scans for `ext.properties` in all folders, not just extension folders'__ by AGulev
Fix an inconsistency where the Editor scans `ext.properties` in all folders, while `bob.jar` only scans extension folders.

__FIX__: ([#11736](https://github.com/defold/defold/pull/11741)) __'Fix text layout regression'__ by britzl
This fixes a regression and discrepancy between how fonts are viewed in the editor and rendered in the engine. Monospace font padding were not properly respected and trailing spaces had an incorrect length.

__FIX__: ([#11746](https://github.com/defold/defold/pull/11746)) __'Fix Android resource detection'__ by ekharkunov
Fixed issue when bundle resources doesn't detected as valid Android resources because of additional .DS_Store files

__FIX__: ([#11104](https://github.com/defold/defold/pull/11175)) __'Copy dynamic libs into result bundle'__ by ekharkunov

Handle recovery of lost sound device on Windows.

__FIX__: ([#11663](https://github.com/defold/defold/pull/11663)) __'Fix a rare potential ANR issue on Android'__ by AGulev
The expensive part of window termination on android was moved from the looper thread to the engine thread to prevent potential ANRs when terminating a window.

__FIX__: ([#11673](https://github.com/defold/defold/pull/11674)) __'Fixed missing tracking when doing layout of glyphs'__ by JCash


__FIX__: ([#11685](https://github.com/defold/defold/pull/11685)) __'Added support for `.jpeg` files for models'__ by JCash
Previously, models could only refer to .jpg or .png files.

__FIX__: ([#11683](https://github.com/defold/defold/pull/11720)) __'Added check if font glyph bitmap will fit into the font glyph texture before uploading'__ by JCash
This fixes an issue where blitting an image outside of the texture size is throwing errors on OpenGL backend.


## Editor
__NEW__: ([#11528](https://github.com/defold/defold/pull/11571)) __'Added 'Help' to the list of permitted locations for editor scripts'__ by AGulev


__NEW__: ([#7047](https://github.com/defold/defold/pull/11441)) __'Breakpoints tab view'__ by JosephFerano
Breapoints Tab has been added to the Tool's Panel which allows the user to manage all breakpoints in their project. Breakpoints also received an enhancement with the ability to toggle their enabled state, allowing users to temporarily disable them without deleting them. Breakpoints also now persistent across sessions so you don't lose them when you close the project.

__NEW__: ([#11600](https://github.com/defold/defold/pull/11600)) __'Skip unnecessary traversal in update-overrides'__ by matgis
Skipping some graph traversal in the `update-overrides` step that concludes transactions is now around 14.7 times faster. In the large project we were testing with the `update-overrides` step during the initial project loading went from taking 1:43 to 6.8 seconds, resulting in a 27% project load time improvement.

__NEW__: ([#11276](https://github.com/defold/defold/pull/11595)) __'Added an ability to specify `library.defold_min_version` for extensions to prevent using incompatible extensions '__ by AGulev
Extensions that define `library.defold_min_version` are now validated against the current Defold version.
If the extension requires a newer version than the one being used, the build will fail with an error message.

__NEW__: ([#11630](https://github.com/defold/defold/pull/11630)) __'Decrease editor memory pressure from transaction steps'__ by matgis
Refactored the data structures we use to represent atomic changes to the editor graph. This yields a small improvement to peak memory usage when loading the project.

For comparison, in our large test project, the transaction steps needed to load the project went from `1.02 GB` to `695 MB`. In practice, the improvement will not be directly reflected as a corresponding decrease in peak memory usage, but the change puts less pressure on the garbage collector and enables further optimizations.

__NEW__: ([#11607](https://github.com/defold/defold/pull/11642)) __'Add a window title to splash, welcome, and project loading'__ by JosephFerano
Defold now has an OS window title while starting up, showing the welcome screen, and during the project loading window.

__NEW__: ([#11406](https://github.com/defold/defold/pull/11696)) __'Editor: Add drag and drop from Assets to Properties Resource Picker'__ by JosephFerano
Allow dragging and dropping of assets from the Asset Browser pane into a Resource Picker in the Properties pane.

__NEW__: ([#4156](https://github.com/defold/defold/pull/11748)) __'Move project dependencies into their own separate category in the Assets panel'__ by vlaaad
In projects with many dependencies, having them all in the main folder can be disruptive. To improve this, all dependencies are moved into a separate Dependencies folder at the same root level as the project.

__NEW__: ([#11676](https://github.com/defold/defold/pull/11708)) __'Add `zlib` module to editor scripts'__ by vlaaad
Now, the editor scripts' Lua runtime has `zlib` module — with the same semantics as the engine's `zlib` module.

__NEW__: ([#11396](https://github.com/defold/defold/pull/11715)) __'Do not rename items on double-click in the outline (keep only F2 for renaming)'__ by AGulev


__FIX__: ([#9702,#9401](https://github.com/defold/defold/pull/11559)) __'Fix issues around textures shared between Model Scenes'__ by matgis
Texture resources shared across multiple Model Scenes (`.gltf` files) will now properly share VRAM resources.

__FIX__: ([#11568](https://github.com/defold/defold/pull/11568)) __'Revamp the Properties view'__ by vlaaad
We have now refreshed the Properties view.

https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7a215758-fe39-4b9b-991f-4cf46db9f833

It looks better than it was before; it shows the updates immediately, and its styling is now more consistent with the rest of the editor, particularly with the editor scripts UI.

__FIX__: ([#11556](https://github.com/defold/defold/pull/11569)) __'Fixed an issue where the camera component icon would disappear after copy-pasting a camera component'__ by AGulev


__FIX__: ([#11570](https://github.com/defold/defold/pull/11570)) __'Improve project open performance in large projects'__ by vlaaad
A project now opens approximately 15% faster (as measured on a large project with thousands of assets: time to open reduced from 3m36s to 3m02s on my machine).

__FIX__: ([#11601](https://github.com/defold/defold/pull/11601)) __'Improve project load performance by 19%'__ by vlaaad
This performance optimization improves project load performance on big projects. As measured on a large project, the load time decreased from 3:01 to 2:25, a 19% improvement.

__FIX__: ([#11604](https://github.com/defold/defold/pull/11604)) __'Improve project loading performance of large projects by 4%'__ by vlaaad
This change defines resource types for common file formats (binary and text) to avoid binary/text detection during project load.

__FIX__: ([#10688](https://github.com/defold/defold/pull/11593)) __'Editor: Optimize atlas preview generation'__ by JosephFerano
Working with Atlases now have better performance characteristics. Changes to image and animation properties that do not affect the atlas texture are now near instant, and changes to Atlas properties that do require recalculation perform faster. Finally, an error is now shown in the Scene View when texture page count exceeds 8 pages, since that is the maximum supported amount.

__FIX__: ([#8463](https://github.com/defold/defold/pull/11617)) __'Editor: Optimize Atlas Preview Image Generation for faster iterations'__ by JosephFerano
The time it takes to generate a new atlas preview after changing its properties was reduced significantly. It should now be around 6x faster on slower machines. As well, dragging/dropping images or moving them up/down in the Outline view of an Atlas when working with Animations will no longer trigger a recalculation.

__FIX__: ([#11619](https://github.com/defold/defold/pull/11652)) __'Editor: Fix exception when showing Context Menu for a missing resource'__ by matgis
Accessing the Context Menu for a deleted image file referenced from an Atlas no longer throws an exception.

__FIX__: ([#11655](https://github.com/defold/defold/pull/11655)) __'Exclude insignificant entries when applying gui property overrides in the editor'__ by matgis
When applying property overrides to Gui nodes, filter out entries that have no significance. This significantly shrinks the list of affected nodes and properties that will need to be applied when loading, which saves around 82 MB of memory and a few seconds of load time in the large project we're testing with.

__FIX__: ([#4959](https://github.com/defold/defold/pull/11693)) __'Add an embedded sound component instead of using a raw sound'__ by AGulev
When a raw sound component is added to a GameObject, it is automatically wrapped and converted into an embedded sound component.

__FIX__: ([#8442](https://github.com/defold/defold/pull/11700)) __'Select the first element by default in forms where choosing an option reveals additional settings'__ by AGulev
In some forms, it’s not immediately clear that menu selections reveal additional options. To improve this, those options are selected by default.

Here’s an example showing how the same file looks to the user immediately after opening it, before and after the changes:
<img width="1448" height="762" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b799cfa4-b1f8-459d-a6b6-096cb182c1ec" />

__FIX__: ([#11532](https://github.com/defold/defold/pull/11753)) __'Limit max height of editor script dialogs'__ by vlaaad
Now, editor dialogs are limited in height. Users are encouraged to use the `editor.ui.scroll()` container for dialogs that may display a lot of content.

__FIX__: ([#11690](https://github.com/defold/defold/pull/11690)) __'Add `/prefs/...` editor HTTP server enpoints'__ by vlaaad
Now, the editor's HTTP server allows querying and modifying the preferences using its `/prefs/...` endpoints.

Use a `GET` request for reading all preferences:
```sh
$ curl http://localhost:$(cat .internal/editor.port)/prefs | jq
{
  ...big JSON blob...
}
```

Or a group of settings:
```sh
$ curl http://localhost:$(cat .internal/editor.port)/prefs/build | jq
{
  "lint-code": true,
  "texture-compression": true,
  "open-html5-build": true
}
```
Or a single setting:
```
$ curl http://localhost:$(cat .internal/editor.port)/prefs/build/texture-compression | jq
true
```

Use a `POST` request for writing:
```sh
$ curl http://localhost:$(cat .internal/editor.port)/prefs/build/texture-compression -X POST -d 'false'
```
